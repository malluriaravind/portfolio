		<h3>Face Mask Detection Alert System</h3>

		<p>As no of covid-19 cases are increasing a lot in the country day-by-day. We must follow the social distancing. Not only social distancing there is another important parameter that we should consider that everyone should wear the mask when they go outside.By this parameter we can reduce the covid-19 cases. But many people are neglecting to wear the masks. By this no of cases are gradually increasing. To avoid such cases I am implementing the face mask detection alert system. The basic advantage of face mask detection alert system is that it identifies the person who is not wearing the mask.It will send an email to the authority that the person is not wearing the mask with his/her photo as an attachment. By this we can reduce the covid-19 cases for some extent.
		<br>
		<br>
		This kind of face mask detection alarm system has applications at Airports, Hotels, Public Buildings like Driving License Offices and other major places where we expect large public gatherings. We will be using Python, OpenCV, CNN, Keras framework with Tensorflow as backend for building the Deep Learning Convolutional Neural network model. We will be training this model on google col-lab using gpu instances. Model training of neural networks based deep learning models take less time to get trained on gpu instances. In this project we have the dataset that consists of 1376 images. In that 690 images are categorized as with mask and 686 images are categorized in to without mask. We have to train a model that detect that person is wearing a mask or not.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h5>STEPS FOR FACE RECOGNITION ALERT SYSTEM</h5>
		<br>
		<br>
		1. Configure working directory and Mount Google Drive to make use of Google Colab.
		<br>
		<br>
		2. Data Pre-processing to convert images to Grayscale and separate out labels and images.
		<br>
		<br>
		3. Build a convolutional Neural Network using Sequential API of Keras.
		<br>
		<br>
		4. Train the Face Mask Detection classifier on Image Data using Keras and Tensorflow as Backend.
		<br>
		<br>
		5. Evaluate the model to see the Loss and Accuracy in Graphical Form.
		<br>
		<br>
		6. Save or Serialize the Face Detection Classifier Model.
		<br>
		<br>
		7. Download the model on the Local System and load it in the program.
		<br>
		<br>
		8. Use the Live Webcam Video Stream to detect the face.
		<br>
		<br>
		9. Extract the region of Interest of the face.
		<br>
		<br>
		10. Engage the trained Facemask Detection Model to the face identified and determine if the person is wearing Mask or not.
		<br>
		<br>
		11. Throw a Warning message in terms of Pop Up window to highlight that Access Denied if the person did not wear the mask.
		<br>
		<br>
		12. Trigger an Email to the concerned person/authority alerting them if the person is not wearing the mask.

		<p>Using google colab first we need to change the runtime to gpu, because when you train your model your model will be trained on gpu instance. We need to mount our google drive so that we can access various files and dataset etc; that we will upload on google drive. Here we have set of configuration commands to setup necessary environment to mount to our google drive.</p>
		<div class="img-container">

		</div>

		<p>First we are importing the drive from google colab and we have mount function associated with the drive</p>
		<div class="img-container">

		<p>We are importing necessary keras packages, numpy and Opencv2 packages that are needed for the face recognition alert system. We have to define the dimensions of single image as 112*112 pixels. I have defined the variables img_rows, img_cols stores the dimension values of the images. Then we are defining the two empty lists named images and labels. Images list will store all the images after we perform grayscale and resizing. Labels list will contain labels corresponding to the classes of the image. We are using the nested for loops first for loop is used for picking the each class directory namely with mask and without mask from google drive from the location of Data_Dir. Next for loop is used to get all the list of image files from specific directory. Once we get the individual image we are then using os.path.join method to join folderpath with that individual image. After we want to read that image using imread function. We have used try and except block for error handling. Inside the try block we are converting the image into grayscale and resizing the image into 112*112 pixels. Later we are appending that image in the images list before we are assigned it earlier. Corresponding category is appended to labels list and theexception block will handle any error occurs. Normalising the image by dividing with number 255 and reshaping the image array without changing the data of image array. Since our labels are in the form of with mask and without mask so we need to perform the one hot encoding so that our label data can be understood by our deep learning model. One hot encoder needs the data in integer encoded form. We are importing the label binarizer from sklearn .preprocessing package and creating the object of label binarizer and named it as lb. we are then using fit transform method to apply label binarizer on each label. Then we are using to_categorical method to convert labels to one hot encoded form and converting in to arrays using numpy arrays function. This is required because deep learning models understands the data in the form of vector or array form. Next we are dividing the train_test_split method to divide our images into training and test dataset. I have taken the size of test dataset to be 25%.  </p>
