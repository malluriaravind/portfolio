		<h3>Movie Recommendation System</h3>
		<p>Recommender systems encompass a class of techniques and algorithms that can suggest “relevant” items to users. They predict future behavior based on past data through a multitude of techniques including matrix factorization.
			In this article, I’ll look at why we need recommender systems and the different types of users online. Then, I’ll show you how to build your own movie recommendation system using an open-source dataset.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h5>Why Do We Need Recommender Systems?</h5>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>We now live in what some call the “era of abundance”. For any given product, there are sometimes thousands of options to choose from. Think of the examples above: streaming videos, social networking, online shopping; the list goes on. Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like.
The easiest and simplest way to do this is to recommend the most popular items. However, to really enhance the user experience through personalized recommendations, we need dedicated recommender systems.
From a business standpoint, the more relevant products a user finds on the platform, the higher their engagement. This often results in increased revenue for the platform itself. Various sources say that as much as 35–40% of tech giants’ revenue comes from recommendations alone.
Now that we understand the importance of recommender systems, let’s have a look at types of recommendation systems, then build our own with open-sourced data!</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>There are basically two types of recommender systems:-</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Content Based Filtering- Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in mind, the input for building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.</p>
		<br>
		<br>

		</div>
		<p>Collaborative Filtering- With collaborative filtering, the system is based on past interactions between users and movies. With this in mind, the input for a collaborative filtering system is made up of past data of user interactions with the movies they watch.
		For example, if user A watches M1, M2, and M3, and user B watches M1, M3, M4, we recommend M1 and M3 to a similar user C. You can see how this looks in the figure below for clearer reference.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Let's load the data now</p>
		<br>
		<br></p>
		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/movie-7.PNG">
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>This data is stored in a matrix called the user-movie interactions matrix, where the rows are the users and the columns are the movies. Now, let’s implement our own movie recommendation system using the concepts discussed above.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h6>The Dataset</h6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>For our own system, we’ll use the open-source MovieLens dataset from GroupLens. This dataset contains 100K data points of various movies and users.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>We will use three columns from the data:</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>userId</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>movieId</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>rating</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="img-container">

		</div>
		<h5>Designing our Movie Recommendation System</h5>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>To obtain recommendations for our users, we will predict their ratings for movies they haven’t watched yet. Movies are then indexed and suggested to users based on these predicted ratings.
		</p>
		<p>To do this, we will use past records of movies and user ratings to predict their future ratings. At this point, it’s worth mentioning that in the real world, we will likely encounter new users or movies without a history. Such situations are called cold start problems.
		</p>
		<h6>Cold Start Problems</h6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Cold start problems can be handled by recommendations based on meta-information, such as:</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>For new users, we can use their location, age, gender, browser, and user device to predict recommendations.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>For new movies, we can use genre, cast, and crew to recommend it to target users.</p>
		<h5>Implementation</h5>
		<p>For our recommender system, we’ll use both of the techniques mentioned above: content-based and collaborative filtering. To find the similarity between movies for our content based method, we’ll use a cosine similarity function. For our collaborative filtering method, we’ll use a matrix factorization technique.
			The first step towards this is creating a matrix factorization based model. We’ll use the output of this model and a few handcrafted features to provide inputs to the final model. The basic process will look like this:
			Step 1: Build a matrix factorization-based model
			Step 2: Create handcrafted features
			Step 3: Implement the final model</p>
		<h6>Step 1: Matrix Factorization-based Algorithm</h6>
		<p>Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommender systems. This family of methods became widely known during the Netflix prize challenge due to how effective it was.
			Matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the user-movie interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices, say U and M. The decomposition is done in such a way that the product results in almost similar values to the user-movie interaction matrix. Here, U represents the user matrix, M represents the movie matrix, n is the number of users, and m is the number of movies.
			Each row of the user matrix represents a user and each column of the movie matrix represents a movie.
			</p>

		</div>
		<p>Once we obtain the U and M matrices, based on the non-empty cells in the user-movie interaction matrix, we perform the product of U and M and predict the values of non-empty cells in the user-movie interaction matrix.
			To implement matrix factorization, we use a simple Python library named Surprise, which is for building and testing recommender systems. The data frame is converted into a train set, a format of data set to be accepted by the Surprise library.</p>
